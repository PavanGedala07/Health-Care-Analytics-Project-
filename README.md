The Power BI Healthcare Analytic Dashboard project, focused on hospital-clinic reports, offers comprehensive healthcare data analysis. Key elements of the project include:

Average Wait Time: Analyzing patient wait durations to assess service efficiency and potential delays.
Patient Satisfaction: Measuring average satisfaction scores to identify factors contributing to positive or negative experiences.
Total Patient Visits Monthly: Tracking patient visits month-over-month to understand demand patterns.
Administrative vs. Non-Administrative Appointments: Differentiating appointments to study their impact on system efficiency, particularly regarding wait times and patient satisfaction.
Referrals and Walk-Ins: Assessing how referred and walk-in patients affect healthcare flow and service delivery.
Patient Visits by Age Group and Race: Exploring demographic data to highlight healthcare needs and diversity in patient populations.
Objectives and Insights:
Efficiency Assessment: The dashboard highlights bottlenecks, long wait times, and areas for operational improvements. By analyzing patterns in wait times, healthcare providers can allocate resources better, identify peak times, and reduce patient waiting periods.

Enhancing Patient Satisfaction: The satisfaction analysis aims to correlate factors like wait times, appointment types, and visit types (referral or walk-in) with overall patient experience, helping facilities improve their services based on patient feedback.

Tracking Patient Inflows: Monthly visit data helps in forecasting and resource planning, providing insights into peak periods and off-season trends, enabling staff optimization and better handling of patient load.

Impact of Appointment Types: By differentiating between administrative (e.g., billing or paperwork) and non-administrative (e.g., clinical consultations) appointments, the report can reveal how administrative burden impacts patient care and satisfaction.

Referral vs. Walk-In Dynamics: The balance between referrals and walk-ins helps understand how scheduled appointments compare to on-demand visits, which can impact service delivery, patient flow, and satisfaction levels.

Demographic Insights: Analyzing patient visits by age and race provides insights into the demographic diversity of patients. This can lead to targeted healthcare services, ensuring equitable healthcare provision across different communities.

This detailed dashboard helps healthcare administrators make data-driven decisions to optimize operations, improve patient care, and address areas that impact overall efficiency and satisfaction.
